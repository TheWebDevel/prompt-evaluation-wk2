### Gaps in the Prompt

| Gap / Issue                 | Why It Matters                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Role is not clearly defined | The assistant is not told it should act like a billing support specialist, so the answers might stay too general.            |
| Product context is missing  | Without details about plans, billing cycles, or refund rules, the response may not be accurate or helpful.                   |
| No guidance for data        | The assistant doesn‚Äôt ask for things like invoice number, account email, or last 4 digits of the card, which slows down help.|
| Tone and length not set     | If there is no instruction to be polite, short, or clear, the assistant might write in different ways each time.             |
| Privacy rule is missing     | No reminder to hide personal or sensitive information, which could cause privacy problems.                                   |
| No response structure       | The assistant doesn‚Äôt follow a clear order like ‚Äúsorry ‚Üí explain ‚Üí next step,‚Äù so the reply can feel confusing.              |
| No error-handling steps     | If the customer info is not complete, the assistant doesn‚Äôt know what to do next.                                            |
| No truth check included     | Without warning, the assistant might guess policy details, which can lead to wrong answers.                                  |

##  Evaluation

‚ö†Ô∏è Quick note: Simple billing tasks like this are not hard for modern large models. But to really test how much the prompt design matters, the first test was done using **Mistral-7B-Instruct** ‚Äî a smaller model that reacts more strongly to prompt quality. üõ†Ô∏è This helped to clearly see how each prompt change affected the output.

After tuning the prompts, the same queries were tested on **o3** and **GPT-4o**. As expected, these bigger models handled the numbers and policy rules even better, showing that the prompt improvements worked well across all model sizes.

### Query #1
``` text
Our Enterprise contract (Net-30, PO #9001) is overdue by 16 days, so the portal tacked on a $15 late fee‚Äîyet the CFO insists the PO terms override your late-fee rule. Meanwhile, the card on file (Visa ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 1234) expired, the email contact left the company, and the tax jurisdiction just changed from Texas to Delaware. Can you sort out payment, waive penalties, update the billing contact, and confirm the correct sales-tax rate‚Äîall without interrupting service?
```

#### Original Prompt's Response
```
 I understand that your Enterprise account (Account ID: AC-872134, Email: sathishkumar0416@gmail.com) has an overdue invoice (INV-1148) with a $15 late fee due to a 16-day delay. However, your CFO insists that the Net-30 terms of your PO (PO #9001) override our late-fee rule.

To address this issue, I will reach out to our accounting team to request a waiver of the late fee based on the PO terms. This process may take a few business days for review and approval.

Additionally, I see that the card on file (Visa ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 1234) has expired. I will update the payment method in your account with a new valid card. Please provide the new card details as soon as possible to avoid any disruption in service.

Regarding the change in tax jurisdiction from Texas to Delaware, I will update your account information accordingly. For Delaware, the sales tax rate is currently 0%. Please note that this rate may change, and we will notify you if there are any updates.

Lastly, I will update the billing contact information for your account with the new email address and other necessary details.

Once these changes have been processed, I will confirm the updated invoice details and send you a notification. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact our support team.

I'm sorry for any inconvenience with your Enterprise account, PO #9001. I understand your CFO's concern about the late fee, and I'll look into it. However, our system follows the standard late-fee policy for net-30 invoices. I'll reach out to our accounting team to request a waiver of the late fee based on the PO terms.

Regarding the expired card, I'll need to update the payment method. Could you please provide the new card details? (‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ **** **** **** ****) and cardholder name.

For the billing contact, I'll need the new email address (f***@d**.com) and name to update the account.

Lastly, for the tax jurisdiction change, I'll need to confirm the new sales tax rate for Delaware. I'll look that up and update your account accordingly.

Once I have all the necessary information, I'll make these changes and confirm back with you. If you have any other questions, please let me know.
```
#### Refined Prompt's Response with CoT
```
Apologies for the inconvenience with your overdue Enterprise invoice, PO #9001. I understand your concern about the late fee and the PO terms. To clarify, our policy states that late fees are waived once per account per calendar year upon request. However, I'll need to verify some details before proceeding:

1. Could you please provide the updated billing email address and contact information?
2. I see that the card on file has expired. Please send the new card details securely: Visa ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ **** **** **** 1234.
3. Regarding the tax jurisdiction change, I'll look up the correct sales tax rate for Delaware.

Here's a summary of how this applies:

‚Ä¢ Late fees are typically non-waivable, but we can waive them once per account per year.
‚Ä¢ Your account has not requested a waiver this year, so we can consider this request.
‚Ä¢ To proceed, I need updated billing information and the new card details.

Once I have this information, I'll process the waiver and update your account accordingly. I'll also confirm the correct sales tax rate for Delaware and apply it to your invoice.

Next steps:
1. Provide updated billing information and new card details.
2. Allow up to 2 business days for processing.
3. Check your email for confirmation of the update.

If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know. If we're unable to resolve this, I'll escalate the issue to my supervisor. Your service continuity is a priority.

#### Refined Prompt's Response with CoT in GPT-4o

Sorry for the confusion and thanks for laying everything out so clearly. Here's what I found:

Summary of Events
‚Ä¢ Upgraded to Pro Annual on May 2 ‚Äî $790 paid
‚Ä¢ Added 3 extra admins on May 12 ‚Äî 2 over quota ‚Üí $20 overage
‚Ä¢ Disputed a duplicate charge on May 15 ‚Äî Stripe case CB-5411
‚Ä¢ Current invoice INV-1148: $20 (overage) + $15 (late fee), due June 16
‚Ä¢ Refund request made after 25 days of service

Policy Mapping
‚Ä¢ No refund ‚Äî Annual plans are non-refundable after 25 days
‚Ä¢ Downgrade and cancelation ‚Äî Allowed, but takes effect at end of term (May 2, 2026)
‚Ä¢ Dispute risk ‚Äî If CB-5411 remains unresolved, account may suspend automatically 7 days from dispute (i.e., May 22)
‚Ä¢ Late fee ‚Äî Eligible for one-time waiver
```

#### Refined Prompt's Response with CoT in o3
```
Sorry for the trouble. You upgraded to Pro Annual on 2 May 2025 ($790), added extra admins on 12 May, opened a Stripe dispute on 15 May, and now want to return to Starter, cancel renewal, and know your costs.

Why this works out
-   Plan used for more than 25 days ‚Üí annual fee is non-refundable.
-   Extra-admin overage: 7 admins ‚Üí 2 over quota ‚Üí $20.
-   Late fee on unpaid overage added 16 Jun ‚Üí $15.
-   One late-fee waiver allowed each year.
-   Disputed charge CB-5411 may suspend the account 7 days after the bank‚Äôs final decision unless the open invoice is settled.

Next steps
1.  Pay or clear Invoice INV-1148 for $20 (if you want the fee waived) or $35 (if not).
2.  Tell us now if you‚Äôd like the $15 fee waived‚Äîone-click fix.
3.  Auto-renew has been canceled and the downgrade is queued. Your plan will switch to Starter on 2 May 2026; access continues until then.
4.  Resolve the Stripe dispute promptly to avoid any pause in service.

Let me know if you need anything else or want us to waive the fee.

### Query #2
``` text
We upgraded from Starter monthly to Pro annual on May 2, paid $790 up-front, then added three extra admins on May 12, disputed a duplicate charge on May 15 (Stripe case CB-5411), and now want to downgrade back to Starter, cancel auto-renew, and get a prorated refund minus all discounts‚Äîbut only if it won‚Äôt suspend our account during the ongoing dispute. What‚Äôs the exact amount and timeline?
```

#### Original Prompt's Response
```
Based on the information provided, here's a breakdown of your situation and the steps you need to take:

1. Downgrade to Starter plan: Since you want to downgrade to the Starter plan before the end of your Pro annual term, your downgrade will take effect at the end of the current term, and you won't receive any prorated credit for the remaining days in the Pro plan.

2. Cancel auto-renew: When you cancel auto-renew, your account will continue to have access to the Pro plan until the end of the current term.

3. Prorated refund: To get a prorated refund for the unused days in your Pro annual plan, you need to request it within 30 days of the payment date. However, since you have an ongoing dispute with Stripe (CB-5411), it's important to consider the potential impact on your account.

4. Dispute resolution: If the dispute is not resolved by the time you request the refund, your account may be suspended. You can contact Canny support to request a manual payment for the overdue invoice to prevent account suspension. Once the dispute is resolved, you can then request the prorated refund.

To calculate the prorated refund amount, subtract the discounts you received (10% yearly discount) from the total paid for the Pro annual plan ($790) and then find the number of unused days in the term. The refund amount would be the result of this calculation.

For example, if the dispute resolution takes 15 days, and the term length is 365 days, the number of unused days would be 350. The prorated refund would be calculated as follows:

Prorated refund = (Total paid - Discounts) * (Unused days / Total days)
Prorated refund = ($790 - ($790 * 0.1)) * (350 / 365)

Keep in mind that the services used for more than 25 days are not refundable. In your case, since you added three extra admins on May 12, which is more than 25 days into the term, those costs are not refundable.

Therefore, the prorated refund would only cover the base Pro annual plan cost, minus

1. Apologies for the confusion with your billing situation. To help resolve your query, we'll need a few more details:
   - The exact date of the disputed charge.
   - The invoice number related to the disputed charge (if known).

2. Based on the information provided, here's a general outline of the steps to follow:

   a. Downgrade your plan to Starter: This will take effect at the end of your current term. No prorated credit will be given.

   b. Cancel auto-renewal: Your account will no longer be charged upon renewal.

   c. Prorated refund: To get a prorated refund for the unused portion of your Pro annual plan, you can request this from our billing team. However, we cannot process the refund until the dispute with Stripe is resolved.

   d. Refund amount: The refund will be calculated by subtracting any discounts (e.g., the 10% yearly discount) from the total amount paid for the Pro annual plan.

   e. Timeline: Once the dispute is cleared or the invoice is paid manually, the refund will be processed.

   f. Account suspension: During the dispute resolution process, your account may be suspended if the payment processor marks the charge as "disputed." If you'd like to avoid this, you can pay the disputed charge manually to clear the dispute.

3. If you provide the invoice number related to the disputed charge, we can look up the exact date and help expedite the process.

4. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please let me know.

5. If the dispute cannot be resolved, or if the account balance is insufficient to cover the disputed charge, we may need to escalate the issue to our billing team for additional assistance.

Model:  Apologies for any inconvenience with your billing request. To provide an accurate response, I'll need the following details:

1. Your account ID or email address.
2. The exact invoice number(s) in question.
3. The last 4 digits of the card used for payment.

With this information, I can look up your account and provide a detailed breakdown:

1. Upgrade from Starter to Pro Annual on May 2, 2025, for $790.
2. Added 3 extra admins on May 12, resulting in a $10 overage charge.
3. Disputed a duplicate charge (Stripe case CB-5411) on May 15.

Based on the information provided, here's the current situation:

1. Your account is not suspended due to the ongoing dispute.
2. You have an open invoice (INV-1148) with a $20 overage charge and a $15 late fee (due on June 16, 2025).

To downgrade to Starter, cancel auto-renew, and get a prorated refund, follow these steps:

1. Downgrade to Starter: Your downgrade will take effect at the end of your current term (May 2, 2026). No prorated credit will be issued.
2. Cancel auto-renew: Your access will continue until the end of your current term.
3. Prorated refund: Since you've used the service for more than half of the annual term, you'll receive a prorated refund for the unused portion of your Pro Annual plan, minus any discounts you've received.

To calculate the prorated refund amount, please contact our billing team at billing@canny.io, providing your account details and the invoice number(s) in question. They will be able to process your refund request and confirm the exact amount and timeline.

## Conclusion

The **Refined Prompt ‚Äì with CoT** gives the best mix of clear wording, policy coverage, and complete answers. It uses a step-by-step reasoning setup that helps any model‚Äîbig or small‚Äîgo through all the policy rules. Even smaller models give good answers, with just small mistakes in numbers.

When the **same prompt** is tested on stronger models like **o3** and **GPT-4o**, those small math issues go away. These larger models keep the same strong structure and also return correct refund amounts and date details, making the reply even more reliable.
